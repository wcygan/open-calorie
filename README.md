# Open Calorie

> Track your calories with just a picture

Open-source calorie tracking app that allows you to log your meals by simply taking a photo. The app uses a self-hosted LLM to process the image and provide accurate nutrient estimates.

## Objectives

- Build an open-source platform that enables instant meal logging via photo
- Deliver accurate nutrient estimates (calories, protein, carbs, fats, and optionally micronutrients)
- Server-side processing, client-side data storage

## Tech Stack

- Self-Hosted LLM
- Server (process photos via LLM, send data)
- Client (send photos, receive data)
